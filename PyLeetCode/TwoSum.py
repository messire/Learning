# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

# Output: [0,1]

nums = [3, 2, 4]

# Output: [1,2]

Output: [0, 1]
